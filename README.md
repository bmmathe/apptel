# apptel
Light-weight application telemetry built in .Net.  Your web sites, services, and apps send usage data to a database which is then aggregated and viewed in the apptel web site in the form of a dashboard with drill-downs.  Monitor your apps by glancing at health monitors and usage graphs.  Setup alerts based on thresholds.
